And we don't want the exact same image for every blog post because that wouldn't make the article stand out when it was shared to Twitter. \n\nThat's where `og-image.now.sh` comes in. We can simply pass the title of our blog post to our generator service and it will generate the image for us on the fly!\n\nIt looks like the following:\n\n```html\n<head>\n  <title>Hello World</title>\n  <meta property=\"og:image\" content=\"https://og-image.now.sh/Hello%20World.png\" />\n</head>\n```\n\nNow try changing the text `Hello%20World` to the title of your choosing and watch the magic happen ‚ú®\n\n## Deploy your own\n\nYou'll want to fork this repository and deploy your own image generator.\n\n1.

Can be either `svg` or `png`.  `svg` is recommenced if it is supported.\n\nFor example the SVG badge for [ALIEN, e x p a n s i o n .](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44/alien-e-x-p-a-n-s-i-o-n)\nthe path would be `44/alien-e-x-p-a-n-s-i-o-n/badge.svg`\n\nYou can also think of it as adding `/badge.svg` to the existing Ludum

playing.  **Default:** `false`\n\n\n### Center\n\n`center` indicates if the game is centred outside of fullscreen mode. **Default:** `true`\n\n\n### Block Keys\n\nIf `blockKeys` is set keys which are used to interact with the game are blocked from scrolling when the game is running.\n\nIf un-set keys will only be blocked when the canvas is focused.  **Default:** `false`\n\n\n### Use Pointer\n\nIf `usePointer` is set the pointer hand will be used on buttons.\n\nIf un-set a normal cursor will be used on all buttons which do not lead to a new page. **Default:** `true`\n\n\n### Unpause On Reset\n\nIf `unpauseOnReset` is set hitting the reset button when paused will instantly reset the game.\n\nIf un-set the game will need to be resumed before it resets. **Default:** `true`\n\n\n### Placeholder\n\nThe image to be used as a placeholder prior to starting the game.

For each turn, if the snake wasn't\nthe largest on the board, or if the health was below a specific\nthreshold, the snake would navigate towards the closest food. Otherwise,\nit would try to target the other snakes' heads to either eliminate the\nopponent in a head-on collision or trap them by cutting off their path.\nThe snake also included an unused passive state, where she would try to\nloop back around to her tail to avoid collisions.\n\n### Drawbacks<a id=\"sec-1-1-1\" name=\"sec-1-1-1\"></a>\n\nThe snake's biggest drawback was trapping itself in its own tail. We\ndidn't implement an effective algorithm to calculate dangerous regions\nof the board, and ultimately the snake died by going for takedowns and\nboxing itself in.\n\n## Battle History<a id=\"sec-1-2\" name=\"sec-1-2\"></a>\n\n**Bounty Snakes:**\n-   Beat two of [Bambora](https://www.bambora.com/en/ca/)'s bounty snakes\n-   Beat [Rooof](https://www.rooof.com/)'s bounty snakes\n-   Beat [Giftbit](https://www.giftbit.com/)'s bounty snakes\n-   Beat [GitHub](https://github.com)'s two snakes in only 67 moves\n-   Beat [Sendwithus](https://www.sendwithus.com/)' three bounty snakes\n-   Beat [Semaphore](https://semaphoresolutions.com/)'s zombie snakes and hungry snake\n-   Lost to one of [Bambora](https://www.bambora.com/en/ca/)'s bounty snakes\n-   Lost to [Accio](https://myaccio.com/)'s defensive snake\n-   Lost to [AppColony](http://www.appcolony.ca/)'s tron snake\n-   Lost to [Redbrick](https://rdbrck.com/)'s champion snake\n-   Lost to [Workday](https://www.workday.com/)'s bounty snake\n-   Lost to [CheckFront](https://www.checkfront.com/)'s two bounty snakes\n\n**Tournament:**\n\nThe snake came third in both our rounds of the battle.

I only use `install.sh` to configure fresh Linux installs.\nMake sure you understand what each files does before you use it.  Use at your own risk!\n\n## Workflow\n\n### Distro\n\nI currently run Debian 9 with GNOME as its super pretty, user-friendly and light.\n\n### Desktop Enviroment\n\nFor my main window manager I use i3 for easier mouse-less navigation and nice tilling, ensuring no wasted screen real estate.  Specifically I use the i3-gaps fork which makes things a little less cramped.\n\nFor window composting I use Compton to provide nice shadows and transparency.\n\nMy application launcher is Rofi which lets me launch and switch apps in a Spotlight like manner.\n\nFor a file manger I use Nautilus with Papirus icons (Looks like MacOS).  I was using Nemo for a while but I found Nautilus to be better in terms of the layout.\n\nTo keep most apps looking fresh I use the Arc GTK theme which is the best dark theme I have ever come across.\n\nFor better Linux fonts I use Infinality to mimic MacOS font styling.  I also use the System San Francisco font as my standard font which looks beautiful when browsing the web.\n\nMy notifications are delivered through dunst making each notification customizable and non-intrusive.\n\n### Audio\n\nFor managing my audio and volume levels I use pavucontrol which is a really simple audio mixer app under Linux.\n\n### Documents\n\nPDF viewing is done using the default Debian reader Evince.\n\n### Text Editing\n\nMost of my text editing/word-processioning happens in Emacs however for the occasionally last ditch edit I use Neovim when I really screwed something up and am stuck in TTY.  The Org mode plugin in Emacs allows me to export LaTeX, replacing any office suite software.  Emacs also allows me to use a UNIX like shell when I'm on Windows which is always a plus.  However the biggest reason I use Emacs is its modal editing thanks to evil-mode and great git integration with git gutter and Magit.  Composing email with this modal editing is really nice in Emacs with mu4e and mbsync despite the complex setup and broken links.  Emacs' Dired mode also provides a really great way to batch rename files as if it was text.  In short, I really like using Emacs.\n\n### Terminal\n\nI use the standard GNOME Terminal running ZSH as my main shell with TMUX for multiplexing.  Having a native shell beats out the Lisp interrupted shell of Emacs thanks to the great auto-complete and vi mode of ZSH.\n\n### Web\n\nFor web browsing I still use Chrome for its syncing features despite the privacy problems.\n\n### Drawing\n\nFor tablet drawing on my laptop I use Xournal since it has great stylus support and tracks nicely.\n\n### Multimedia\n\nAny photo manipulation still happens with Photoshop under WINE.  While I feel that GIMP is a capable program I don't think I will ever be able to adapt after using Photoshop for many years.\n\nFor 3D modeling and rendering Blender does the job as its supper flexible and fast under Linux (when compared to its Windows port).\n\n### Windows Subsystems for Linux\n\nWhen I must run Windows, I run Ubuntu under Windows Subsystems for Linux in Mintty.  Mintty supports 256 colors which most Windows terminal emulators are missing.  In my ZSH config it is setup to alias any program in `system32` which means that I can run tons of native Windows commands in a UNIX shell which is neat.\n\n## Usage\n\nI don't recommend that anyone copy and install this whole config (See warning).  However if you insist on doing so simply clone the repo and run `sudo ./install.sh`.\n\nI highly suggest that you cherry pick the elements you want into your own config and build your own config.\n\nWhile this can be intimidating it will result in a system configured better to your needs.  I hope that this repo will provide a good example of the extreme tweakabilty of Linux.\n\n## Screenshots\n\n### i3wm\n\n![img](./screenshots/i3-1.png \"i3wm1\")\n\n![img](./screenshots/i3-2.png \"i3wm2\")\n\n### Emacs\n\n![img](./screenshots/emacs.png \"Emacs using a custom powerline with challenger-deep\")\n\n![img](./screenshots/emacs2.png \"Emacs using the Helm narrowing completion framework\")\n\nMy Emacs setup consist of [challenger-deep](https://github.com/MaxSt/challenger-deep) as a theme with a custom [Powerline](https://github.com/milkypostman/powerline).\nEmacs setup also heavly relies on [Helm](https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm)\n\n### Neovim\n\n![img](./screenshots/vim.png \"Neovim using Airline and NERDTree\")\n\nNeovim config uses [dracula-vim](https://github.com/dracula/vim).\nAirline theme is **light** from [airline-themes](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline-themes).\n\n### Mintty\n\nMintty uses [dracula-mintty](https://github.com/dracula/mintty) for its color definitions.\n\n### Tmux\n\n![img](./screenshots/tmux.png \"Tmux using usings splits and a custom theme\")\n\nTmux uses a modified version of [tmux-airline-dracula](https://github.com/sei40kr/tmux-airline-dracula) named **wracula** which matches **BASH** and **ZSH**.\n\n### BASH and ZSH\n\n![img](./screenshots/zsh.png \"ZSH using Oh My ZSH with the git and syntax plugins\")\n\nThis config contains a modified versions of both [agnoster-zsh-theme](https://github.com/agnoster/agnoster-zsh-theme) and [agnoster-bash](https://gist.github.com/kruton/8345450) dubbed *wagnoster* for **BASH** and **ZSH**.\nLS Color are tweaked version of **dircolors.ansi-dark** from [Solarized Color Theme for GNU](https://github.com/seebi/dircolors-solarized).\nZSH addtionaly uses [zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting) package.\n"}}},{"node":{"name":"java-formatter","description":"‚òï A Java Formatter Style for Eclipse","url":"https://github.com/woofers/java-formatter","homepage":"","stars":{"totalCount":0},"license":{"name":"GNU General Public License v3.0"},"topics":{"nodes":[{"topic":{"name":"java"}},{"topic":{"name":"eclipse"}},{"topic":{"name":"formatter"}}]},"readme":{"text":"# Java Formatter\r\n\r\n**A Java Formatter Style for Eclipse**\r\n\r\nSimple set of Java rules that mimic [Michael Breen's Rational Java Indentation and Style](http://mbreen.com/javastyle.html) and [GNU Standards](https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Formatting.html).\r\n\r\n![img](./screenshots/format.png \"Format\")\r\n\r\n## Acknowledgments\r\n\r\n-   **GPL 2016-2017**, *Jaxson Van Doorn*\r\n\r\n## Other Projects\r\n\r\n-   [Woofers3D](https://github.com/woofers/woofers3d)\r\n\r\n-   [Whale](https://github.com/woofers/whale)\r\n\r\n-   [K9Krew](https://github.com/woofers/k9-krew)\r\n\r\n-   [Dotfiles](https://github.com/woofers/dotfiles)\r\n"}}},{"node":{"name":"woofers3d","description":"üê∂ A 3D game API designed to be effortless and simple to use.
