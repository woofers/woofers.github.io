And we don't want the exact same image for every blog post because that wouldn't make the article stand out when it was shared to Twitter. \n\nThat's where `og-image.now.sh` comes in. We can simply pass the title of our blog post to our generator service and it will generate the image for us on the fly!\n\nIt looks like the following:\n\n```html\n<head>\n  <title>Hello World</title>\n  <meta property=\"og:image\" content=\"https://og-image.now.sh/Hello%20World.png\" />\n</head>\n```\n\nNow try changing the text `Hello%20World` to the title of your choosing and watch the magic happen âœ¨\n\n## Deploy your own\n\nYou'll want to fork this repository and deploy your own image generator.\n\n1. Click the fork button at the top right of GitHub\n2. Clone the repo to your local machine with `git clone URL_OF_FORKED_REPO_HERE`\n3. Change directory with `cd og-image`\n4. Make changes by swapping out images, changing colors, etc (see [contributing](https://github.com/zeit/og-image/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more info)\n5. Run locally with `now dev` and visit [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)  (if nothing happens, run `npm install -g now`)\n6. Deploy to the cloud by running `now` and you'll get a unique URL\n7. Setup [GitHub](https://zeit.co/github) to autodeply on push\n\nAlternatively, you can do a one-click to deploy with the button below.\n\n[![Deploy to now](https://deploy.now.sh/static/button.svg)](https://zeit.co/new/project?template=zeit/og-image)\n\nOnce you have an image generator that sparks joy, you can setup [automatic Now + GitHub](https://zeit.co/github) deployments so that pushing to master is also deploying to production! ðŸš€\n\n## Authors\n\n- Steven ([@styfle](https://twitter.com/styfle)) - [ZEIT](https://zeit.co)\n- Evil Rabbit ([@evilrabbit](https://twitter.com/evilrabbit_)) - [ZEIT](https://zeit.co)\n"},"readmeOrg":null}},"pageContext":{"repo":"opengraph-api"}}}
