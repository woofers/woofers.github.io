For each turn, if the snake wasn't\nthe largest on the board, or if the health was below a specific\nthreshold, the snake would navigate towards the closest food. Otherwise,\nit would try to target the other snakes' heads to either eliminate the\nopponent in a head-on collision or trap them by cutting off their path.\nThe snake also included an unused passive state, where she would try to\nloop back around to her tail to avoid collisions.\n\n### Drawbacks<a id=\"sec-1-1-1\" name=\"sec-1-1-1\"></a>\n\nThe snake's biggest drawback was trapping itself in its own tail. We\ndidn't implement an effective algorithm to calculate dangerous regions\nof the board, and ultimately the snake died by going for takedowns and\nboxing itself in.\n\n## Battle History<a id=\"sec-1-2\" name=\"sec-1-2\"></a>\n\n**Bounty Snakes:**\n-   Beat two of [Bambora](https://www.bambora.com/en/ca/)'s bounty snakes\n-   Beat [Rooof](https://www.rooof.com/)'s bounty snakes\n-   Beat [Giftbit](https://www.giftbit.com/)'s bounty snakes\n-   Beat [GitHub](https://github.com)'s two snakes in only 67 moves\n-   Beat [Sendwithus](https://www.sendwithus.com/)' three bounty snakes\n-   Beat [Semaphore](https://semaphoresolutions.com/)'s zombie snakes and hungry snake\n-   Lost to one of [Bambora](https://www.bambora.com/en/ca/)'s bounty snakes\n-   Lost to [Accio](https://myaccio.com/)'s defensive snake\n-   Lost to [AppColony](http://www.appcolony.ca/)'s tron snake\n-   Lost to [Redbrick](https://rdbrck.com/)'s champion snake\n-   Lost to [Workday](https://www.workday.com/)'s bounty snake\n-   Lost to [CheckFront](https://www.checkfront.com/)'s two bounty snakes\n\n**Tournament:**\n\nThe snake came third in both our rounds of the battle.
