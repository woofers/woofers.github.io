I'm *Jaxson Van Doorn*, a software developer living in *Victoria, BC*.

Primarily focused in *computer graphics*, *user experience* and *language design*.

When I'm not working on software I can be found playing games, working on my car or relaxing with my dog.

Full-time [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] and [[https://www.gnu.org/][GNU]] enthusiast (ask me about my [[https://github.com/woofers/dotfiles][Dotfiles]]).

Currently attending full-time /Computer Science courses/ at [[https://uvic.ca][University of Victoria]].

Here are some open source software projects I have authored:
