#+TITLE: Hey I'm Jaxson
#+TYPE: about

I enjoy doing both /frontend/ & /backend/ web design work as-well as the occasional /game/ for fun.

Most of my open-source projects these days are with [[https://reactjs.org/][React]] + [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript][JavaScript]], [[https://www.java.com][Java]] or [[https://www.lua.org/][Lua]].

Currently studying my *4th* year of /Computer Science/ at [[https://uvic.ca][University of Victoria]].

You can find some of my [[/][projects]] on this site.

More projects can be found on my [[https://github.com/woofers][GitHub]], along with my [[https://jaxson.vandoorn.ca/resume/jaxsonvd-resume.pdf][resume]].
