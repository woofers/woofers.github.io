Recently [GitHub](http://github.com) announced that [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) will be [moving away](https://github.blog/2019-08-08-github-actions-now-supports-ci-cd/) from the original [HCL](https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl) syntax in-favour of a [YAML](https://yaml.org/) format
similar to [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) and [Bitbucket Pipelines](https://bitbucket.org/product/features/pipelines).  This means that [HCL](https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl) style actions will no longer work [after September 30, 2019](https://developer.github.com/actions/).  It is possible to migrate using a [migration script](https://help.github.com/en/articles/migrating-github-actions-from-hcl-syntax-to-yaml-syntax) however in-some cases it may be required to reconfigure.

This particular issue occurred to me as actions which return a neutral result seem to fail the whole build with the [YAML](https://yaml.org/) format.  This means that using [actions/bin/filter](https://github.com/actions/bin/tree/master/filter/bin) to trigger a deploy would fail the build unless a release tag was found.  With this in mind, reconfiguring my [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) seemed like the best choice.

## Desired Behaviour

My particular use of [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) is for deploying my small [NPM packages](https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-node-js-modules).

To keep it simple I wanted the following to occur:

-   Install dependencies, Build and Test package on each commit
-   Publish package if a release tag was created

## Creating the Action Configuration

Create the file `.github/workflows/workflow.yml`

### Checking for Tag

This method simply builds and tests the package on any commit.

Then if it finds a tag starting with **v**, it will trigger a deploy.

So if a [GitHub Release](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-releases) is created with the tag **v2.3.4**, it will trigger a deploy.

This is a bit naive however for my purposes I usually don't tag unless its a release.

One advantage of checking for a tag this way is that it cuts down on unneeded builds as a whole build can only ever run 1 or 2 times (2 in the case a build is deployed).

The [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) docs mentions being able to [restrict actions](https://help.github.com/en/articles/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#example-restricting-the-workflow-run-to-specific-refs-and-paths) to certain branches or tags however I could not get this to work.

```yaml
name: build # Name Action Build

on: [push]  # Trigger on push

jobs:
  run:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest                         # Run on Ubuntu Docker image
    steps:
    - name: Checkout Repo                          # Checkout repo
      uses: actions/checkout@v1
    - name: Use Node.js                            # Configure Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v1
      with:
        node-version: '12.9'                       # Set Node.js Version
        registry-url: 'https://registry.npmjs.org' # Set Node.js reigistry
    - name: Deploy Info                            # Print GitHub Deploy info
      env:
        GITHUB_CONTEXT: ${{ toJson(github) }}
      run: echo "$GITHUB_CONTEXT"
    - name: Install                                # Install dependancies
      run: npm install
    - name: Build                                  # Build app if needed
      run: npm run build --if-present
    - name: Test
      run: npm run test --if-present               # Run tests if needed
    - name: Publish
      if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/v')    # Check if publish step should run
      run: npm publish --access public             # Publish package
      env:
        NODE_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_AUTH_TOKEN }} # Set NPM auth token from GitHub Secrets
```

### Checking for a Release

If you found the previous method too naive, you may want to check for a [GitHub Release](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-releases) before triggering a deploy.

The drawback to this is that a few extraneous builds will be triggered as the `release` event will fire both when the release is `created` and `published`.  As far as I am aware this can not be restricted using the `on` property.

To ensure we only deploy once, we will indicate to only run the **Publish** step when a release is `published`.

```yaml
name: build

on:
  push:     # Run build on push (commit in most cases)
    tag: [] # Only run build if not tagged
  release:  # Run build on release
    tag:
    - v*    # Check for release tag

jobs:
  run:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest                         # Run on Ubuntu Docker image
    steps:
    - name: Checkout Repo                          # Checkout repo
      uses: actions/checkout@v1
    - name: Use Node.js                            # Configure Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v1
      with:
        node-version: '12.9'                       # Set Node.js Version
        registry-url: 'https://registry.npmjs.org' # Set Node.js reigistry
    - name: Deploy Info                            # Print GitHub Deploy info
      env:
        GITHUB_CONTEXT: ${{ toJson(github) }}
      run: echo "$GITHUB_CONTEXT"
    - name: Install                                # Install dependancies
      run: npm install
    - name: Build                                  # Build app if needed
      run: npm run build --if-present
    - name: Test
      run: npm run test --if-present               # Run tests if needed
    - name: Publish
      if: github.event_name == 'release' && github.event.action == 'published' # Check if publish step should run
      run: npm publish --access public             # Publish package
      env:
        NODE_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_AUTH_TOKEN }} # Set NPM auth token from GitHub Secrets
```

## Setting NPM Auth Token Secret

Simply go to your repo **Settings** and select the **Secrets** tab.

Then **Add a new secret** with the **Name** of `NPM_AUTH_TOKEN` and set the **Value** to your [NPM token](https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-and-viewing-authentication-tokens).

## Adding the GitHub Actions badge

[GitHub](http://github.com) now offers an undocumented API which will return nice [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) like status badge.

An example can be seen on the [actions/toolkit](https://github.com/actions/toolkit) repo.

The format for the API is as follows:

```markdown
https://github.com/<user|org>/<repo>/<action_name>/badge.svg
```

The `action_name` propery is the `name` field in the [YAML](https://yaml.org/) which in this case is `build`.

An example of this would be:

```markdown
https://github.com/woofers/ludum-dare-badges/workflows/build/badge.svg
```

To make it even nicer we can link the badge to our repo's actions page:

```markdown
[![img](https://github.com/woofers/ludum-dare-badges/workflows/build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/woofers/ludum-dare-badges/actions)
```

It will look something like this:

[![img](https://github.com/woofers/ludum-dare-badges/workflows/build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/woofers/ludum-dare-badges/actions)
