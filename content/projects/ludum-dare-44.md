# Instructions

Be careful as hitting human ships will deplete your life meter and more importantly will lead to unwarranted attention and hence will detract from your score/pay.

However capturing a human will restore a small amount of life and the increase your score.  Additionally flying past human ships will also add to your score.

Capture as many ships as possible to achieve a high payday and satisfy the scientists.
