[[https://github.com/woofers/ludum-dare-badges/actions][https://github.com/woofers/woofers.github.io/workflows/build/badge.svg]]

A [[https://www.gatsbyjs.org/][Gatsby]] based site built using static [[https://orgmode.org/][Org Mode]] content with [[https://github.com/xiaoxinghu/orgajs][Orga]].

Automated deploy to [[https://pages.github.com/][Github Pages]] is configured using [[https://github.com/features/actions][GitHub Actions]].

* Goals
1) Be easy to update and maintain content.  Ideally with simple [[https://orgmode.org/][Org Mode]] markup.
2) Take full-advantage of wide screen sizes while still scaling to a wide-variety of screen sizes.
3) Load quickly; nothing is worse than a /slow/ site.

* Modules

This sites uses a variety of open-source modules to keep the lights on.  Here are some of the key plug-ins:

- [[https://www.gatsbyjs.org/][Gatsby]] provides an extremely easy [[https://reactjs.org/][React]] + [[https://webpack.js.org/][Webpack]] with a great plug-in ecosystem allowing content to be pulled in any format.
- [[https://github.com/xiaoxinghu/orgajs][Orga]] allows [[https://orgmode.org/][Org Mode]] parsing using the [[https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/node-apis/][Gatsby Node APIs]].  A useful example and the skeleton of this site can be found [[https://github.com/xiaoxinghu/gatsby-orga][here]].
- Code highlighting on posts is powered by [[https://prismjs.com/][Prism]].
- [[https://emotion.sh/][emotion]] dynamically generate CSS for different components.
- [[https://github.com/danawoodman/react-fontawesome][Font Awesome]] is used to easily add vector icons.
- [[https://github.com/KyleAMathews/typography.js][typography.js]] handles font styling.

* Usage
*** Running Locally
Running locally for development can be done with:
- ~yarn install~ or ~npm install~ to install the required modules.
- ~yarn dev~ or ~npm dev~ to host locally in development mode.
Now going to [[http://localhost:8000][localhost:8000]] will display the site.

** Building for Deployment

Building the static site can be done with:
- ~yarn build~ or ~npm build~.
A ~public~ folder will be generated with the created bundle.
