He left his Nano-Bulbous-Gravitron-Phaser v3, a cosmic dog toy, at home.\nHis issue is that his home, the kennel planet, is on the other side of the galaxy 5 000 000 dog years away.\n\nUsing nearby planets' gravitational pull, DB aims to use the power of ORBITing gravity to make it home a couple of dog years shorter.\n\n\n# Instructions\n\nHop to the orbit of the next planet using the **SPACE** key.\nThe tip of the ship should be pointed at the planet you intend to move to.\nIf you miscalculate the trajectory of the planet, you will orbit in-space forever and need to restart.\nYou can not move to planets in the opposite direction of travel as the gravitational force is moving strongly to the right\nand attempting to move against it will result in the shuttle doing a flip.\n\n\n## Controls\n\n-   **Space** - Jump planets / menu\n\n\n## About\n\n**DOGE: BOIS** - Dangerous Orbit Genesis: Endgame; Beyond our Intergalactic Space\n\nSmall game created in under 48 hours for [Discord Jam 2](https://itch.io/jam/discord-jam-2) with the theme of **Space**.\n\nOur game takes place in **space** and is controlled only using the **SPACE** key.\n\nGame is built using [Lua](https://www.lua.org/), with the [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) Fantasy Console.\n","date":"","post":"discord-jam-2"}},"__N_SSG":true}
