For each turn, if the snake wasn't\nthe largest on the board, or if the health was below a specific\nthreshold, the snake would navigate towards the closest food. Otherwise,\nit would try to target the other snakes' heads to either eliminate the\nopponent in a head-on collision or trap them by cutting off their path.\n\n## Tournament - Stay Home and Code\n\nThe snake beat six other competitors the second round of Group B to qualify for the Quaterfinals, where it was eliminated. There were 32\ncompetitors in the veteran division. Our games were played on a 11x11 board with 4 food spawned at start.\n\nTimestamp on the [BattlesnakeOfficial Twitch stream](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/602731416) is [2:16:32-2:25:35](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/602731416?t=02h16m32s) for Group B, and [4:04:08-4:15:18](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/602731416?t=04h04m08s) for Quaterfinals.\n\n**[Group B - Round 1](https://clips.twitch.tv/BeautifulCuteKleeResidentSleeper)**\n\n**[Group B - Round 2](https://clips.twitch.tv/CrackyElegantWaspPartyTime)**\n\n**[Quaterfinals - Round 1](https://clips.twitch.tv/WrongBitterDragonflyRitzMitz)**\n\n**[Quaterfinals - Round 2](https://clips.twitch.tv/PluckyElegantMouseEleGiggle)**\n\n**[Quaterfinals - Round 3](https://clips.twitch.tv/WanderingHonorableCurlewPeteZaroll)**\n\n\n## Usage\n\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n1.
