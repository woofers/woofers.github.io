Then on desktop\nthis component optionally supports a fully-featured modal.\nAlternatively the sheet can be used on desktop as-well if so desired.\n\n## Features\n\n- Responsive way to display blocking modal-like content on mobile web-apps.\n- Accessible with proper scroll & focus blocking, with `Esc` to close on desktop.\n- Supports dark and light mode out of the box\n- Customizable detents\n- Similar API to Apple's UIKit sheet\n- Supports Server-Side rendering.\n- Built with css-modules (no styled-in-js library needed)\n\n## Screenshots\n\n<h3>Light Mode</h3>\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"/screenshots/light-mode-1.png\" width=\"45%\" alt=\"react-sheet-slide fully expanded and scrolled up in light mode.\" />    <img src=\"/screenshots/light-mode-2.png\" width=\"45%\" alt=\"react-sheet-slide fully expanded and scrolled down in light mode.\" />\n</p>\n<h3>Dark Mode</h3>\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"/screenshots/dark-mode-1.png\" width=\"45%\" alt=\"react-sheet-slide fully expanded and scrolled up in dark mode.\" />    <img src=\"/screenshots/dark-mode-2.png\" width=\"45%\" alt=\"react-sheet-slide fully expanded and scrolled down in dark mode.\" />\n</p>\n\n\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7284672/174498349-04c57aba-9a94-41a5-ac46-92206120ff9e.mov\n\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7284672/174498361-39b9196a-93ab-45ea-bba8-31cc48c02025.mov\n\n## Installation\n\n**Yarn**\n\n```yarn\nyarn add react-sheet-slide @react-spring/web@^9 @use-gesture/react@^10\n```\n\n**npm**\n\n```npm\nnpm install react-sheet-slide @react-spring/web@^9 @use-gesture/react@^10\n```\n\n## Motivation\n\nThis library is largely based on the fantastic [react-spring-bottom-sheet](https://github.com/stipsan/react-spring-bottom-sheet).  While [react-spring-bottom-sheet](https://github.com/stipsan/react-spring-bottom-sheet) is much more feature-packed than `react-sheet-slide`, supporting more props like many different callbacks on sheet snap start/end.\nHowever the extra dependencies like `xstate` and the `resize-observer` polyfill can lead to a larger bundle size.\nAlso using `react-spring` as a dependencies instead of a peer dependencies limits users of the library from\ncontrolling the version of `react-spring` they use. It can also lead to 2 versions of `react-spring` being bundled,\nif the user is using a newer or older major version than the library.\n\nBy simplifying the API these libraries can be removed, and by moving `react-spring` to a peer dependencies\nmakes the library have a much lighther footprint.  Also `react-sheet-slide` includes a\ndark mode and a fully-featured desktop modal that can be enabled for non-mobile users.\nIt also adds support for a backdrop animation similar to Apple's UIKit.\n\n## Usage\n\n```jsx\nimport React, { useState, useRef } from 'react'\nimport { Sheet, Header, Content, Footer, detents, Portal } from 'react-sheet-slide'\nimport 'react-sheet-slide/style.css'\n\nconst App = () => {\n  const [open, setOpen] = useState(false)\n  const ref = useRef()\n  return (\n    <div className=\"rss-backdrop\" style={{ background: '#f7f8f8', minHeight: '100vh' }}>\n      <button type=\"button\" onClick={() => setOpen(true)} style={{ display: 'flex', margin: '28px auto 0' }}>\n        Open sheet\n      </button>\n      <Portal>\n        <Sheet\n          ref={ref}\n          open={open}\n          onDismiss={() => setOpen(false)}\n          onClose={() => {\n            console.log('Component unmounted')\n          }}\n          selectedDetent={detents.large}\n          detents={props => [\n            detents.large(props),\n            detents.fit(props)\n          ]}\n          useDarkMode={false}\n          useModal={false}\n          scrollingExpands={true}\n        >\n          <Header>Title</Header>\n          <Content>\n            <div style={{ padding: '54px 16px 24px' }}>\n              <div>Add more storage to keep everything on online</div>\n              <div>\n                Online includes plenty of storage to keep all your data safe and\n                features to protect your privacy.\n              </div>\n              <div>Learn More About Online</div>\n            </div>\n          </Content>\n          <Footer>\n            <button type=\"button\" onClick={() => setOpen(false)}>\n              Close\n            </button>\n          </Footer>\n        </Sheet>\n      </Portal>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n`react-sheet-slide` includes a `Portal` component however other portal can be used like\n`@reach/portal` or `@mui/base`.  The one included is just of modified version of `@reach/portal` however with support for string refs and defaults to `body`.\n\n`rss-backdrop` is required to apply to the sheet backdrop effect.  Omitting it will disable any backdrop styles on the sheet.\n`react-sheet-slide` will also set a `body` background when the sheet is open to create the inset for the backdrop effect.\nAs such it is recommended to apply the background to a top level `div` or other container, in addition to the `body`.\nIf you want to keep your `body` background, use `!important`.\n\n## Props\n\n- `open`\n\n  Set if the sheet is open.  When this prop is changed the sheet\n  will animate and the unmount/remount.  When the component fully unmounts, `onClose` will be called.\n\n- `onDismiss`\n\n  Called when the sheet is dragged down or the user clicks on the backdrop.  Also called when the user presses `Esc`.\n  This method should include `setOpen(false)` to ensure `open` is false.  Otherwise the sheet may not close properly.\n\n- `onClose`\n\n  Called when the sheet finishes the close animation and is fully unmounted.\n\n- `selectedDetent`\n\n  The default detent size that the sheet will open to.\n\n- `detents`\n\n  List of available detents that the sheet will catch on.  Reccomened to set to either `detents.large` or `props => [detents.large(props), detents.medium(props)]`\n  to mimic the UIKit behaviour however can be customized using the callback.\n\n- `useDarkMode`\n\n  Prop to control if dark mode is enabled.  By default this will use the system `prefers-color-scheme`.\n\n- `useModal`\n\n  Prop to control when a modal should be used instead of a sheet.  If your app will likely only be used on mobile `useModal={false}` is reccomened.\n  Otherwise it will default to true on any device larger than `(max-width: 640px)` to use a modal on desktop.\n\n- `scrollingExpands`\n\n  Determines if scrolling up on the sheet body will expand the sheet.  Once the sheet is expanded\n  to the max detent, the sheet will be scrollable.  Disabled by default to provide a more predictable scroll behaviour\n  however enabling it if possible is recommended.\n\n- `ref`\n\n  The sheet also supports forwarding a ref that will be added onto the sheet root.\n"},"readmeOrg":null,"fullName":"React Sheet Slide"},"title":"React Sheet Slide","buttons":[{"key":"no type","name":"View Demo","link":"https://jaxs.onl/react-sheet-slide/","showText":true,"divider":true},{"key":"github","name":"GitHub","link":"https://github.com/woofers/react-sheet-slide","external":true}]},"__N_SSG":true}
